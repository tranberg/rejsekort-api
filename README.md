Rejsekort API
=============

Non-official API to extract personal travel information from Rejsekort.

**Caution:** this API has access to everything within Rejsekort Self Service. Be careful.

Python
----

Create a file in the root of the project called `creds.ini` with the following content:

    [creds]
    username = <username>
    password = <password>

You can create a username and password at the [Rejsekort Self Service](https://selvbetjening.rejsekort.dk).

Then you are able to run [rejsekort-login-test.ipynb](rejsekort-login-test.ipynb) to test the login functionality.

	pip install bs4 jupyter pandas requests
	jupyter notebook .

Node
----

	npm install superagent cheerio
	node fetch-travels.js <username> <password>

The script will output all travels from the last 13 months (Rejsekort limit) formatted for inclusion in Greenbit.

The script is currently only tested for travels starting and ending within the same date.
